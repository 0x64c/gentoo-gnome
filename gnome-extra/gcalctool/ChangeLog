  * Fix for bug #490701 - base radio buttons initially fail.
  
  * Attempted fix for bug #485134 - OR calculation produces incorrect 
  
  result in arithmetic precedence mode. This isn't a complete solution
  
  so the bug has been reopened.
  
  * Fix for bug #488828 - Reciprocal remembers backspaced items.
  
  * More work on bug ##488694 - [a11y] Several calculator buttons don't speak

  adjusted the "shift left" and "shift right" names (they were reversed).
  
  * Patch to stablize arithmetic precedence.

  * Fix for bug #485398 - Put memory register window inside the main window.
  
  Uses gtk_window_set_transient_for() to associate the memory register
  
  window with the main gcalctool window.
  
  * Fix for bug #383850 - [doc] New names for Precedence.
  
  * Fix for bug #485137 - Undo/Redo don't work in arithmetic precedence mode
  
  if user has "hand edited" the display.
  
  * Added a call to "set_memory_toggle(v->rstate);" in make_frames() to
  
  correctly set the state of the Edit-<Memory Registers check box if the
  
  user wanted the memory registers initially displayed.
  
  * Correctly handle memory register display and "Memory Registers" menu
  
  item checkbox status when user goes from Sci/Fin/Adv mode to Basic.
  
  (Needed because of the recent changes for bug #478961).
  
  * Fix for bug #326938 – Display cursor in input area; allow home and 
  
  end keys. This is in arithmetic precedence mode only.
  
  * Fix for bug #484158 – Setting Accuracy is incorrect via the 0-9 places 
  
  menu items.
  
  * Fix for bug #439087 – Gcalctool can't handle small physic constants
  
  like the Boltzmann constant. The number of significant places has
  
  been increased to 99 and the number of displayable digits has been
  
  increased to 200. The online help has been adjusted to reflect these
  
  changes.
  
  Note that if you have something in the gcalctool display that is
  
  wider than the display area, a scrollbar is shown, but the first
  
  digit isn't properly displayed. The workaround here, is to enlarge
  
  the size of the calculator window until the scrollbar goes away.
  
  I believe this is a Gtk+ problem and have filed bug #482688 against 
  
  it.
  
  * Fixed bug #367738 – [doc] Square root documentation needs to be updated.
  
  The entry in the online help now includes examples for both arithmetic
  
  precedence and non-arithmetic precedence mode.
  
  * Fixed bug #428571 – [doc] Repetitive usage of "use".
  
  * Use GNOME_MAINTAINER_MODE_DEFINES() to handle *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
  
  * Fixed bug #428573 – [doc] Spelling of logical gates.
  
  The logical operations, And, Not, Or, Xor and Xnor now use uppercase
  
  letters (AND, NOT, OR, XOR and XNOR) for both the buttons and in the
  
  display area in arithmetic precedence mode. The gcalctool manual
  
  pages and the online help have been updated accordingly.
  
  The XOR operation in non-arithmetic mode was doing a multiplication
  
  instead.
  
  The result for the AND example in the online help was incorrect.
  
  The syntax for using NOT in aritmetic mode is different then for
  
  non-arithmetic mode. The online help example has been updated to
  
  show both examples.
  
  * Fixed bug #469245 – Hexadecimal input is not intuitive and
  
  bug #455889 – Copy/paste of lower case hex letter does not work.
  
  The hexadecimal digits have been changed back to their pre Sept
  
  2003 (bug #118826) values of "a" - "f".
  
  The following functions have also had their keyboard shortcuts
  
  reverted back to their pre Sept 2003 upper-case values:
  
  [A] - Set accuracy
  
  [C] - Change sign
  
  [D] - Double-declining depreciation
  
  [E] - Enter an exponential number
  
  [F] - User-defined functions
  
  With copy/paste operations, where the user is pasting a string into
  
  gcalctool, the copy buffer is now iterated over. If an "A", "B", "C",
  
  "D" or "F" character is encountered, it will be converted to its
  
  lowercase equivalent. If an "E" is found, and the next character is a
  
  "-" or a "+", then it remains as an upper case "E" (it's assumed to be
  
  a possible exponential number), otherwise its converted to a lower
  
  case "e".
  
  Displaying of hex digits in the gcalctool display will still be
  
  in uppercase. Displaying of the "e" in an exponential number will
  
  still be in lower-case.
  
  The way to enter exponential numbers in arithmetic precedence mode
  
  has changed. The following four examples should show you the new
  
  correct syntax:
  
  1 2 Exp + 8 = 1200000000
  
  - 1 2 Exp + 8 = -1200000000
  
  1 2 Exp - 8 = 0.00000012
  
  - 1 2 Exp - 8 = -0.00000012
  
  In both left-to-right precedence and arithmetic precedence modes, if
  
  the user enters a numeric digit that is incorrect for the current
  
  numeric base, this shouldn't be allowed and should not be entered
  
  in the display.
  
  The gcalctool documentation (and tooltips) have been updated to
  
  reflect these changes.
  
  * Fixed bug #479102 – memory registers dialogue should use ngettext.
  
  * Fixed bug #478961 – GtkAaction use.
  
  * Fixed bug #478964 – don't use deprecated gtk_widget_ref func.
  
  * Fixed bug #478979 – show menu help in statusbar.
  
  * Fixed bug #479064 – should use ngettext on the Acc button.
  
  * Fixed bug #479097 – use gtkmessagedialog.
  
  * Fixed bug #479066 – weird way to use gnome menus-have-icons setting.
