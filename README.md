Unofficial Gentoo GNOME overlay
-------------------------------

This overlay was designed for **GNOME 3.10** development for Gentoo.

**But goes wild currently**

 - stable branch is stable and really target **GNOME 3.10**
 - master branch goes forward 3.11 -> ...

NOTE
====

 - There is official gnome overlay: http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/gnome.git;a=summary
 - Also you can try `openrc-force` use flag if you hate systemd (currently awailable only there)
 - Use my overlay only if official team still have no time for reviews / etc ...
