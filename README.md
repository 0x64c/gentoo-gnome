* This is the experimental unofficial gnome overlay, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
* It will probably break your deptree, your system, and your backbone.
* For bugs use github issues https://github.com/Heather/gentoo-gnome/issues?state=open
* Scripts for development available in ./scripts/
* Please use pull --rebase to resolve conflicts
* Or set branch.autosetuprebase = always
* This overlay will be added to layman as `gnome-next` but it's not added yet, you should use it as local overlay.

Why?
----
there is message on official gnome overlay:

* If you plan on forking the overlay to work on some gnome stuff, don't hesitate
  to send us a mail at gnome_at_gentoo_dot_org to inform us or ask for a merge
  of your work.

And it doesn't work. Well, at least it's not that easy. So this overlay is for collaboration.
