  Bump to 2.3.0.1
  	libsoup 2.3.0 is the first beta release of the libsoup 2.4
          series. It is an API break from the earlier 2.2 series that
          fixes various bugs and API warts and lays the groundwork for
          language bindings and various new features in upcoming
          releases.
