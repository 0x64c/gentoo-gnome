  10 Mar 2008; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> libsoup-2.4.0:
  Bump to 2.4.0
  	* Fixed a small memory leak in SoupSession. [#518798, Wouter
            Cloetens]
  
  	* Minor fixes to redirect behavior; PROPFINDs can now be
            automatically redirected (pointed out by Christian Kellner),
            and 302 is treated like 307, not 303. Also fixed to make
            sure that redirect-test actually gets run by "make check".
  
  	* The SoupSocket I/O methods now set nread/nwrote even on
            error. [Benjamin Otte]

  30 Jan 2008; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> gtkhtml-3.17.90.1:

          series. It is an API break from the earlier 2.2 series that

          language bindings and various new features in upcoming
          releases.
