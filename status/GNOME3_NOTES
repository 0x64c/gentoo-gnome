* hamster-applet 2.91 is still an applet; useless with GNOME Shell
* Cheese hasn't been ported to GNOME 3 libraries; no point adding it
* GStreamer is waiting on Ford_Prefect/leio getting time to do it
* gnome-keyring's gtk3 version libgcr -> libgcr-3
  - Difficult to parallel install, though, because other libs are the same
