* Latest vinagre 2.31 release and trunk fail to compile, only live version added
* telepathy-glib-0.13.11 doesn't compile with USE=introspection and latest glib
  - This means empathy can't be added
* libchamplain:0.9 from trunk doesn't compile with latest gtk+:3
  - This also means empathy can't be added
* hamster-applet 2.91 is still an applet; useless with GNOME Shell
* Cheese hasn't been ported to GNOME 3 libraries; no point adding it
* GStreamer is waiting on Ford_Prefect/leio getting time to do it
* gnome-keyring's gtk3 version libgcr -> libgcr-3
  - Difficult to parallel install, though, because other libs are the same
